# Generalized Steppingstone Sampling in PTA
GSS estimator code for PTA

This repository contains the scripts used to conduct the study in " Generalized Steppingstone Sampling: Efficient marginal likelihood estimation in gravitational wave analysis of Pulsar Timing Array data".

## The PTA dataset
This study uses the public data releases in:

- Nanograv: https://github.com/nanograv/15yr_stochastic_analysis.git
- EPTA+InPTA: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/epta/epta-dr2.git


## Folder structre

The folder is organised as each PTA folder contains :
- paper_results: The marginal likelihood text filesfor each models estimate.
- scripts: the diffrent scripts used for this study and a python notebook to reproduce the PTA figures in the paper.

The folder GSS_scripts has the gss generic sampler and notebooks for the simulation study section.
