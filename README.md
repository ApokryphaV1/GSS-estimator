# Generalized Steppingstone Sampling in PTA
GSS estimator code for PTA

This repository contains the scripts used to conduct the study in " Generalized Steppingstone Sampling: Efficient marginal likelihood estimation in gravitational wave analysis of Pulsar Timing Array data".

## The PTA dataset
This study uses the public data releases in:

- Nanograv: https://github.com/nanograv/15yr_stochastic_analysis.git
- EPTA+InPTA: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/epta/epta-dr2.git


## Folder structure

The folder is organized as each PTA folder contains :
- paper_results: The marginal likelihood text files for each model estimate.
- scripts: the different scripts used for this study and a Python notebook to reproduce the PTA figures in the paper.

The folder GSS_scripts has the GSS generic sampler and notebooks for the simulation study section.
